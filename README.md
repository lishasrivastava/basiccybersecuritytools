These are just some basic cybersecurity tools as a side project to learn from.

Current:
1. Port scanner: A tool to scan a given website URL for open ports. The program imports the "socket" library to create a socket object, which it uses to establish connections to the target URL on various ports in the range from 1 to 1024.



Future/In Progress:
2. Vulnerability scanner: A tool that checks a network or system for vulnerabilities and reports them.
3. Password cracker: A tool that uses various techniques to crack passwords, such as dictionary attacks or brute-force attacks.
4. Network sniffer: A tool that captures and analyzes network traffic to detect suspicious activities.
5. Firewall tester: A tool that tests the strength of a network's firewall by attempting to bypass it.
6. Hash cracker: A tool that uses various techniques to crack hashes, such as dictionary attacks or brute-force attacks.
7. Encryption and decryption tool: A tool that can encrypt and decrypt messages or files using various encryption algorithms.
8. Malware analysis tool: A tool that analyzes malware samples to determine their behavior and identify possible threats.
9. Log analysis tool: A tool that analyzes system logs to detect suspicious activities and possible threats.
10. Intrusion detection system: A tool that monitors a network or system for possible intrusions and alerts administrators if suspicious activities are detected.
